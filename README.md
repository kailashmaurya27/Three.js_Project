# AI-Powered 3D Tshirt Customizer

This project is a showcase of cutting-edge technology merging AI and web development to create an immersive experience for users. The website utilizes React.js and Three.js to create a dynamic 3D environment where users can interact with customizable T-shirts.

## Features

- **T-shirt Color Customization:** Users can change the color of the T-shirt using a simple interface.
- **Upload Custom Designs:** Users have the option to upload their own designs onto the T-shirt, which are then processed by AI algorithms to generate a print.
- **AI-Powered Print Generation:** The uploaded designs are processed using AI algorithms to create high-quality prints that seamlessly integrate with the T-shirt.
- **Logo Placement Options:** Users can choose to place the logo at the center of the T-shirt or opt for other placement options.
- **Full T-shirt Design:** Users have the flexibility to set the design as covering the entire T-shirt or opt for partial designs.
